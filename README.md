Bootstrap-force is a simple modification to the Twitter bootstrap CSS/Javscript framework through which it can be used in Visual force pages in Salesforce.com.

This enables you to use all the stylings of Bootstrap without any CSS conflicts with standard Lists/Tables of Apex in visual force pages without even disturning the styles of header and sidebar on VF pages. 

Start with declaring a div with class name "bootstrap-force" nest all the bootstrap markup within.
